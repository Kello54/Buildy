# Architecture Overview

This document provides a high-level view of the V18 Platform architecture.

## Components

- **Frontend**: User-facing interface built with modern web technologies.
- **Backend API**: Provides business logic and data access.
- **Database**: Central storage for structured and unstructured data.
- **Monitoring**: Dashboards and alerts ensure system health.
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Automates builds, tests, and deployments.

## Data Flow

1. User interacts with the **frontend**.
2. Frontend makes calls to the **backend API**.
3. API queries the **database** and applies logic.
4. Results are returned to the user.
5. Monitoring tools track system behavior at each stage.
